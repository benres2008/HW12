  ## Usage: 
  This app is used as a cool game where you can type in a burger of your choice, where this is stored and then able to be "eaten". Of course, "eating" your burger is just pushing a button, where it then shows up in the "burgers devoured" column. You can create as many burgers as you'd like and can eat as many burgers as you'd like, and can name your burger whatever you want. The only problem is that I could not get my code to function. I tried so hard to get the server up and running but I just can't seem to make it work. Whenever I type "server.js" it gives me the weirdest error messages that won't go away no matter what I do. I am going to talk to Poornima about this because it is SO frsutrating to do all of this work and just not have the final step click. Anyways, here is the code that WOULD be functional had I gotten it to work. Also, I cannot sened a link to Heroku obviously because I cannot get it to connect to the server.
